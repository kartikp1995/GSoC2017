This week, I completed the Time Sink. Following are the updates of the week:

### Current Status
#### Completed TimeSink
I have completed TimeSink. I have added GRC integration. Now, you can use Bokeh based Time Sink exactly like QT based time sink. Example is available [here][grc_example].
![TimeSink-Example]({{ site.url }}/{{site.baseurl}}/images/example-timesink.png){:width="75%"}

**Notes on using GRC integration:**
To use GRC integration, we need some changes in core GRC template. The updated core GRC template and corresponding code changes are available in [branch `bokeh_in_gnuradio`][bokeh_branch] in fork of GNU Radio repository.

Once, you install the GNU Radio from that branch, you select `Bokeh GUI` generate option to use in `Options` block.


#### Feedback required
To make these bokeh based GUI a _bug-less_ software, we would like to have feedbacks from the community. You can now test using GRC.
You can drop me an email on [`discuss-gnuradio`][discussion_forum] or review the PR [here][PR] or write an issue [here][issues].

**Some thoughts on the current code structure**
- Can we create a base class for Bokeh based sink blocks?<br>
We don't know if it is feasible, but many functions in both C++ block and Python class looks similiar. Hence, this idea.
- Current GRC XML file is based on QT GRC file. But the code generated with it is too big. I m trying to reduce it.

Suggestions on both of these points are welcome.

-------------------------
### To-Do list for next week:
1. Solve the bugs of TimeSink:<br>
I don't believe my code was perfect. Kindly reinforce my belief! Add as much bugs as possible. It is now easier with GRC integration!
2. Frequency sink:<br>
The frequency sink for float values will be completed in this weekend. The remaining Frequency sink will be completed next week.
3. Update the code for readability and add Doxygen documentations:<br>
Finishing for the upcoming evaluation in the week after next week.
