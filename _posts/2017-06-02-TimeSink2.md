This week, I completed the implementation of Time Sink for floating point values. Following are the updates of the week:

### Current Status
#### Complete TimeSink for floating point:
I have created a PR to _master_ branch of [repository][repo] from _develop_ branch. Kindly review it and test it as much as possible. Kindly give your review to either on the PR or drop me a mail. :)

### Features of the TimeSink
The features in the timesink remains same as `gr-qtgui`. But since we have a major structural difference in the implementation, there is a minute change to use it in `top_block.py`. Please check the [examples][examples] available in PR. We initialize 2 instances. One of them initializes C++ block (i.e. `bokehgui_time_sink_f_proc_0`) and another initializes the Python class. All get/set functions, plot formatting functions are called from Python.

To install the module:
- `mkdir build`
- `cd build`
- `cmake ../`
- `make`
- `sudo make install`
- `sudo ldconfig`

To run the example:
- `python examples/time_sink.py`

The output should be as follows:<br>
![Screenshot]({{ site.url }}/{{site.baseurl}}/images/screenshot-timesink2.png){:width="75%"}

Note: There is a color distortion. The color is incorrectly captured in Screenshot!

To view the tags, run the `examples/time_sink_1.py`. The tags will be displayed on the plot.

-------------------------
### To-Do list for next week:
1. Performance evaluation - We will put the plot on the Internet and analyse how fast can the plot be updated. The Internet will provide a worst case analysis for our purpose. 
2. Solve the bugs of TimeSink for float - So, report as much bugs as possible!
3. Complete TimeSink - Add support for complex value. More or less, things will be same.
4. Add GRC - Will try to add a GRC support by the end of next week
