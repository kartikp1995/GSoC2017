Following are the updates of the week:

### Current Status
#### Layout implemented 
The layouts are implemented. Somethings to note:

Each plots and a *widgetbox*(group of widgets) will get a parameter called *placement* from GRC which called `set_layout` methods of each of those. The placement parameter can have a vector of integers of length 4 of the form `(row, col, rowspan, colspan)`. `(row, col)` are the starting coordinates of the plot and `(rowspan, colspan)` corresponds the size of the plot in the grid. The grid size is of maximum possible row x maximum possible column.

Following figure an example of grid, the placements of various elements inside the grid for the given value of parameters. <br>
![GridPlot Example]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.baseurl }}/images/GridPlot.png){:width ="75%"}

Note: The indexing starts from 0. Also, if only 2 values are provided, the rowspan and colspan will be assumed to be 1.

In background, the Bokeh library can understand the combinations of only Row and Column. Hence, a wrapper function `create_layout` takes a list of plots + widgetbox having the attribute *self.layout* and returns the Bokeh Layout instance (Row or Column containing Row or Column or plot). The recursive logic that implements it is available in the file `python/bokeh_layout.py`

#### The widgets:
The following widgets are completed and ready to use:
1. Textbox
2. Label (basically Textbox without a callback on change)
3. Slider
4. Range Slider
5. Checkbox
6. Chooser

TO BE UPLOADED

-------------------------
### To-Do list for next week:
1. Test the widgets and plots and solve bugs with Layouts
2. Understand how to implement Waterfall plot efficiently with Bokeh plots
